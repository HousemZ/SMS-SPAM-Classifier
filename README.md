# SMS-SPAM-Classifier
I try to classify SMS messages as SPAM or NOT SPAM using various ML algorithms.
This project consists steps to process and explore the dataset, convert messages to vectors and applying different ML algorithms
and techniques to compare them.

Then, I use Multinomial Naive Bayes model to build a web app using streamlit.

Accuracy :0.975822    
Precision :1.000000
